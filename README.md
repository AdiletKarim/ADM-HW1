3. Used the hackerrank compiler and jupyter notebook.
4. All code is saved in Homework_1.ipynb, submissions are saved in HW1.pdf
5. Due to the fact that the time of Kazakhstan was set on my laptop, the pdf file indicates the time ahead of Italy by +4 hours.
(time in Kazakhstan: 11/10/2021 02:51, time in Italy: 10/10/2021 22:51)
